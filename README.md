# WMS - A Bad USB Multitool
This library provides devices with a UDC the ability to act like gadget devices, and perform various types of attacks.

The library is contained in the `wms` directory, `bad_usb` holds prototyping code. The `wms/examples` directory contains some example usages of the library for the three types of attacks implemented.

This library was tested on the USB Armory MKII, but should work on any device that has a UDC.
